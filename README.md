# 🧢 Sneaker & Streetwear Sales Analysis + Customer Segmentation (2022)

This project analyzes sales data for sneakers and streetwear products between **January–August 2022**, focusing on product trends, payment behavior, and customer segments. It includes both **EDA visualizations** and **unsupervised customer segmentation** using clustering techniques.

## 📊 Key Objectives

- Identify top-selling brands and products
- Explore sales distribution by country, gender, and category
- Analyze payment mode trends (Card vs. COD)
- Study monthly changes in payment preferences
- Segment customers based on quantity, spending, and product preferences

## 🧠 Segmentation

We performed **K-Means clustering** to group customer behaviors into 3 distinct segments:
- **High-Value Buyers**: Premium customers with large purchases
- **Mid-Tier Buyers**: Average quantity and spending
- **Budget Streetwear Buyers**: Prefer lower prices and COD

These segments can help brands personalize marketing and improve inventory strategies.
